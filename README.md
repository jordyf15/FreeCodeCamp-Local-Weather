# FreeCodeCamp Local Weather
This is the first take home projects in FreeCodeCamp's Coding Interview Prep where we have to create a local weather application that displays the weather based on the user's current location.

## Application Usage
When user first enters the application they will be prompted to allow this application to access their location.  
   
When allowed the application will fetch the weather based on the user's location and display it on the screen. User can also switch the temperature between celcius and fahrenheit by clicking the top left button wth the F/C label.  
  
When not allowed to access the user's location the application will display an error message that it can't fetch the whether and requested to be allowed to access the user's location.

## Technologies Used
1. React version ^17.0.1
2. React-dom version ^17.0.1

## Project Rules
1. Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
2. Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

## Project Users Stories
1. I can see the weather in my current location.
2. I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
3. I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
